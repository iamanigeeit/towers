# Towers of Ah Boy

Please refer to [the slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/162nbHoVRuvY8ZqZRjQ0GRr34KaZTLiqvvMGdjUFmGNA/edit?usp=sharing).

I model the tower state as a `dict` of `pole : ring_num`.

In addition to the solution from the normal start state, I also have methods to set the state to any messed-up but still valid state, as well as code to solve from any valid state.

Animations in `matplotlib` are included!
